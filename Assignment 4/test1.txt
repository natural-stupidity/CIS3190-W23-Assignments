Once every few decades, maybe every century, a nation will produce a hero.
An Escoffier, a Muhammad Ali, a Dalai Lama, a Joey Ramone, someone who
changes everything about their chosen field, who changes the whole landscape.
Life after them is never the same. Martin Picard is such a man. A heretofore
unencountered hybrid of rugged outdoorsman, veteran chef, with many years of
fine dining experience. Renegade, innovator, he is one of the most influential
chefs in North America. He is also a proud Quebecois, and perhaps he more than
everyone else has defined for a new generation of Americans and Canadians what
that means.
Anthony Bourdain, Parts Unknown 2013.
